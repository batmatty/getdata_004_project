## Variables

For each of the subjects and activity type the signals that are used in this dataset are as follows:

* tBodyAcc_X
* tBodyAcc_Y
* tBodyAcc_Z
* tGravityAcc_X
* tGravityAcc_Y
* tGravityAcc_Z
* tBodyAccJerk_X
* tBodyAccJerk_Y
* tBodyAccJerk_Z
* tBodyGyro_X
* tBodyGyro_Y
* tBodyGyro_Z
* tBodyGyroJerk_X
* tBodyGyroJerk_Y
* tBodyGyroJerk_Z
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

For each of the signals the follwoing set of variables that were estimated from the original dataset are included: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

**NOTE:** The original variables were not changed in anayway

For each of the mean and standard deviations for each of the signals the means were calculated for each subject and activity. This was included in the clean data set .CSV file.
